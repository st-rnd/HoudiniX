# Houdini (iOS 10 -> 10.3.2, iOS 11 -> 11.3.1 and 12 -> 12.1.2)
This is not meant to be a full jailbreak. Abraham initially created it as a PoC (to learn about the iOS file system structure and how far we can modify the system without a full jailbreak) but then it turned into a project for everyone to use.

I (ConorTheDev) have modified it to work with iOS 12 -> 12.1.4!
